Project name is Life
This is a project on which I will be working in long run. If people want to add they can as well, is going to be public, It's is not like any other time tracking app or mood tracking app, it is going to be a great, unique and thought provoking.
This app is about how you are feeling today as whole and will push you to be happy.
Later will add- day steek, rewards point if joy is consistent and is boynd a certain point, punishment points if sad points are consistent, and in case you are peaceful, encourage to be happy.
If require will alter the points system as well right now it's static.
Will later add the ai bot in case need any help for sad part [if required] or self help, and push the peaceful people to be happy.
